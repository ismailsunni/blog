## TLDR

**I move my blog to [https://ismailsunni.hashnode.dev/](https://ismailsunni.hashnode.dev/)**

## Non-TLDR Part

For me, blogging is about writing. It's never about the platform or medium. As long as I can write, I can read it again, or perhaps other people can also read it, that's enough for me.

Blogging with something that you need to set up, maintain, and custom workflow is counterproductive for me. If I have a little time to blog, I want to spend it on writing not figuring out how to upload images, fixing build issues, or something else.

The writing experience with this platform (Gatsby) is not as smooth as I want. I just want to write, and that's all. No time to tweak the blog, search for syntax that I forget, and try to remember the workflow. 

In this case, I am moving my blog to Hashnode. It's a new blogging platform. I think it's good in terms of simplicity. No need for me to do many things besides writing. So far, I have written 5 posts there. The same number as in this blog but in a shorter period of time. Please visit it on [https://ismailsunni.hashnode.dev/](https://ismailsunni.hashnode.dev/). I will probably change the domain or exporting my existing post, but they are something that can wait. The most important part is writing. 

The content is still the same. Blogging about my professional experience from both technical and non-technical aspects. Or even a simple post when I found a useful tool.

So, see you there.
