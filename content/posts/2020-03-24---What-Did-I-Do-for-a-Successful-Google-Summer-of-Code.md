In this post, I will share what did I do for my Google Summer of Code (GSoC). This post will not cover about what I did in technical aspect, but more on non technical one. You can read my [final report](https://ismailsunni.github.io/GSoC-2019/) for the technical one. I mix with some suggestion for you if you want to apply for GSoC also.  This post consist on two parts: my preparation before Google Summer of Code and what I did on the GSoC period.

## Preparation Before GSoC

### Read The Guidelines and GSoC Related Resource

Before I played the game, I want to know the game as much as possible. This is my first step: read the [guideline](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/student/how-gsoc-works.html#). This is important since I want to know what is the rule, requirement, schedule, how it works, the project, and so on. This guideline covers almost everything I need. Beside the guideline, I also join the GSoC mailing list, reading previous GSoC edition report or article.

### Plan My Time

I decided to apply for GSoC in the end of 2018 ( work on GSoC 2019). I planned my time from that time until the end of the GSoC program. I made a schedule based on the GSoC's timeline, my school's timeline, and my own needs. This is so important that I can manage my time properly. I do not want to miss any deadline for sure. I put big commitment in the time line also. Failing to plan is planning to fail. Below is my GSoC timeline.

If you want to create one, you don't need to be very detail. I revised the timeline over and over.

### Choose Organisation and Gather Ideas

I chose OSGeo for the organisation and QGIS as the project. I have already had some knowledge and experience on QGIS, so it is a trivial option for me. If you do not have any preference, browse through the list of accepted organisation (or last year organisation). I suggest to choose the one that you are interested, the one that you use daily, or the one that you have already familiar with. Open Source project sometimes has a steep learning curve. Make sure it is worth it for you.

After that, I gathered ideas from the users and the developers. I also ask previous edition student in the same project. Most of the time, I got a good response. They even give some time to have a video call, give some resource to read, and so on. In my case, QGIS has a list of GSoC ideas also. It's a good place to start.

Another organisation and project perhaps has different way to communicate. On QGIS, we have mailing list for developer. Other perhaps has a more active chat room. Anyway, don't forget to introduce yourself, and keep the good manner :).

Each organisation can have special rule for GSoC. This applies also for OSGeo. Make sure you don't miss it.

### Contact Possible Mentors

For me, finding the mentor is done with finding the idea. I came to the QGIS hackfest in A Coruna, Spain to meet with my future mentor. We discussed the ideas and develop it to be more detail. Thanksfully, I live in Spain at that time, so it's not far from my place. In the hackfest, I also meet other QGIS developers.

### Write Proposal

Everyting is more or less set. I wrote my proposal and share it to the developer mailing list to get comments and feedbacks. Don't forget to sumbit it for sure :)

## On GSoC

### Start Early

### Communication is Important
