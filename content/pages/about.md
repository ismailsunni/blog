I am a software engineer from Indonesia, who currently lives in Muenster, Germany. I've mostly worked professionaly with Python or C++, but also a little bit of JavaScript and R. I do most of my work in Open Source Geospatial Information System (GIS). I develop Web GIS, QGIS Plugin, and core development of open source software like [QGIS](https://qgis.org/en/site/) and [GeoNode](http://geonode.org/). You can check [my GitHub account](https://github.com/ismailsunni) about my latest activity.

Beside GIS, I also interested in 3D, Visualization, Artificial Inteligence, and Machine Learning. But the most important is, I can make other people life easier.

I am currently studying for [Master of Science in Geospatial Technologies](http://mastergeotech.info/) in [University of Muenster](https://www.uni-muenster.de/Geoinformatics/) with a scholarship from the Erasmus Mundus programme. I hold a bachelor of science on Informatic Engineering from [Institut Teknologi Bandung](http://itb.ac.id/), Indonesia.

I like open source and its community. I helped initiating [Python-ID](http://python.or.id/) community in my home town, Yogyakarta and organized several meet up. Currently, I am helping creating [QGIS ID](https://qgis-id.github.io/) community.

On my free time, I like to spend my time with my wife (e.g. she cooks and I eat, travelling together). Football is my hobby. I play, watch, and play the games ([Football Manager](https://www.footballmanager.com/), [Fantasy Premier League](https://fantasy.premierleague.com/). I am also interested in Badminton and Math.
